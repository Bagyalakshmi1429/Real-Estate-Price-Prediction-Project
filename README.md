This project series provides a comprehensive guide on building a real estate price prediction website using machine learning. The project utilizes the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle and walks through the step-by-step process of creating a model using sklearn and linear regression. The series includes the development of a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests and a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and obtain the predicted price by calling the Python Flask server.

Throughout the project, various data science concepts are covered, such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, grid search CV for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, and more. The technologies and tools utilized in this project include Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
